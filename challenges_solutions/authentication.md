# 🔐 Challenge: Authentication & Permissions

## Problem
- Ensuring secure login & registration
- Restricting access based on user roles
- Handling custom user fields (e.g., profile photo)

## Solution
- Implemented Django’s built-in `AbstractUser` for custom user model
- Added groups & permissions
- Used DRF token authentication
